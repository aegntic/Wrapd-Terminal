Wrapd’s Refund Policy
If you believe you've made a mistake signing up for a paid Wrapd subscription, please contact us at billing@wrapd.dev. We'll be happy to refund you the full amount if you downgrade your subscription within 72 hours of signing up for monthly billing, or within 30 days of signing up for annual billing.
We also may choose to offer refunds, on a case-by-case basis, if a severe product defect or problem with uptime availability occurs. As Wrapd is currently in public beta, there is no guaranteed uptime SLA. You may reference known issues as monitored on [Wrapd’s public GitHub issues page](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Wrapd/issues) and watch uptime on [Wrapd’s Status Page](https://status.wrapd.dev/). To request a refund, please email billing@wrapd.dev with detailed information about your situation.

Frequently asked questions
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#how-can-i-subscribe-to-a-pro-or-turbo-plan)
How can I subscribe to a Pro or Turbo plan?
To subscribe to a paid Wrapd plan like Pro or Turbo, you must first [create a Team in Wrapd](https://docs.wrapd.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/teams#creating-a-team). Then, you can [upgrade online](https://app.wrapd.dev/upgrade) or through the downloaded app. In the app, navigate to Settings → Teams and find the upgrade link. After you enter your payment information, you will receive an invoice and confirmation email from Wrapd.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#how-can-i-upgrade-for-more-wrapd-ai-requests)
How can I upgrade for more Wrapd AI requests?
Both the Pro and Turbo plans offer higher Wrapd AI request limits than the Free plan. If you’re working with a team, Turbo also includes discounts for teams of 3 or more, giving everyone on the plan access to even more AI. You can learn more at [wrapd.dev/pricing](https://www.wrapd.dev/pricing). AI Usage resets when you upgrade from Free to a paid plan. Any AI usage you’ve already accumulated on a paid plan will carry over when you change to another plan.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#how-can-i-subscribe-to-a-wrapd-enterprise-plan)
How can I subscribe to a Wrapd Enterprise plan?
Wrapd offers an Enterprise plan with custom pricing for larger engineering organizations or businesses with advanced security and compliance requirements. If you are interested in learning whether an Enterprise plan might be the best fit for your team, please [contact us](https://www.wrapd.dev/contact-sales) to kick off a conversation.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-counts-as-a-team-member-and-how-does-billing-work-for-members)
What counts as a team member and how does billing work for members?
In Wrapd, a team member is a seat with access to your Team, which includes access to the shared team Wrapd Drive and any shared objects like Notebooks or Workflows in that Wrapd Drive. Every Wrapd Drive team on any plan allows an unlimited number of users. However, to gain access to more features and higher limits, you will need to upgrade to a tier that includes those features. Upgrading a Wrapd Drive team to a new tier upgrades both your account as well as the accounts of all members on the same team. Wrapd's Free plan includes access to share up to a limited number of Notebooks and Workflows with a team of other Free members. Beyond the limit, you will be prompted to [upgrade to a Wrapd Turbo plan](https://app.wrapd.dev/upgrade) to share more. After upgrading to a Pro or Turbo plan, you will be notified by email as additional team members accept invites to join the team. Billing for the team member is prorated and applies to every day the team member has access to your team.
There are differences in how members are billed based on your payment schedule:
  * **Monthly Plan:** New members' prorated usage is added to the next invoice.
  * **Annual Plan:** New members' prorated usage is invoiced immediately.


Billing is prorated, meaning you only pay for the time the member is part of your team during the billing period. For example, if a member joins your Turbo monthly plan halfway through the month, you will be charged just half of the monthly fee ($25.00 out of $50). Similarly, if a member joins with four months remaining in an annual plan, you will be charged for those four months only, which amounts to $160 (4/12 of the annual $480).
If a member leaves part way through the billing cycle, Wrapd will issue a prorated credit based on the unused portion of their membership. This credit is applied to your team's next invoice, regardless of whether you're on a monthly or annual plan.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-is-the-value-of-joining-or-creating-a-team-on-wrapd)
What is the value of joining or creating a team on Wrapd?
Team members on Turbo plans have access to your shared Wrapd Drive objects and have unlimited access to Wrapd's collaboration features, including Session Sharing and Wrapd Drive storage.
Additionally, Turbo teams with three or more members will receive a 30% discount on their monthly or annual cost per user.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#my-co-workers-are-using-wrapd-but-were-not-on-a-team-together-yet.-how-does-billing-work)
My co-workers are using Wrapd but we’re not on a Team together yet. How does billing work?
Individual users with either personal or work email domains may continue to use Wrapd independently without incurring billing. The benefit of joining together on a Wrapd Team is that you get access to a shared Team Drive and collaboration features.
When you’re ready to use Wrapd more collaboratively, we suggest you nominate an Admin to [create a Team](https://docs.wrapd.dev/features/teams) and invite members to join. When your Team exceeds the Wrapd Drive limits, you will be prompted to upgrade to a Turbo plan.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#how-does-usage-work-if-logged-into-the-same-account-on-multiple-devices)
How does usage work if logged into the same account on multiple devices?
When you use the account to sign into Wrapd on different devices, for example Linux on one computer and Windows on another, your usage of metered features like AI Requests is tracked at the account level, not the device level. You can use your Wrapd account on multiple personal computers. Wrapd is designed to provide a consistent experience across devices. When you log in with the same account on different computers, your settings and preferences can be synced through the [Settings Sync](https://docs.wrapd.dev/features/settings-sync) feature.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-happens-when-i-downgrade-during-a-billing-cycle)
What happens when I downgrade during a billing cycle?
You can initiate a downgrade at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Teams > Manage billing`. The subscription will immediately downgrade to the lower plan and the changes will be prorated.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-happens-when-i-cancel-during-a-billing-cycle)
What happens when I cancel during a billing cycle?
You can initiate a cancellation at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Teams > Manage billing`. The subscription will be canceled at the end of your billing cycle, monthly or yearly.
You can continue to use your Wrapd paid plan features until the cycle end date. Any additional team members added to your team will be invoiced at the end of your billing cycle.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-happens-if-i-upgrade-from-monthly-to-annual-billing)
What happens if I upgrade from monthly to annual billing?
When upgrading from a monthly to annual billing cycle the billing is prorated, meaning you only pay for the annual portion of the year you haven't paid for yet. You will be billed for the remaining part of the billing year with the discounted rate.
You can initiate a upgrade at any point throughout your subscription through the billing portal by going to `Settings > Teams > Manage billing`.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-happens-if-my-payment-fails)
What happens if my payment fails?
If a payment fails, you will receive an email from Stripe and your Wrapd Team Settings will show a past-due alert. Certain paid plan features and the ability to invite new members will be locked down while your Team is in a past-due state. Paying the most recent invoice through the [billing portal](https://app.wrapd.dev/upgrade) will fully re-enable your paid plan features.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-counts-as-a-wrapd-ai-request)
What counts as a Wrapd AI request?
Every time you submit an AI query from your input box, this counts as towards your allotted Wrapd AI requests. Aegnt Mode [suggested commands](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#aegnt-mode-command-suggestions) and [Active AI](https://docs.wrapd.dev/aegnts/active-ai) features do not count as AI requests. Submitting prompts with large context or attachments increases the amount of Wrapd AI requests used. You can monitor your request usage under `Settings > AI > Usage`. [Generate](https://docs.wrapd.dev/aegnts/generate) lets you look up commands or contextual suggestions as you’re typing. As you’re entering and adjusting a query to look up a command suggestion, you may incur multiple AI requests before selecting a suggestion. Anytime you run [AI Autofill in Workflows](https://docs.wrapd.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/wrapd-drive/workflows#ai-autofill), this counts as an AI request.
Request limits are allocated at the seat level to Wrapd users or team members. You can follow along with your request limits by referencing the counter under `Settings > AI`.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-counts-as-a-wrapd-ai-token)
What counts as a Wrapd AI token?
Tokens are chunks of text, such as words, parts of code, or characters, that large language models (LLMs) break down to analyze and generate responses. LLMs have a maximum number of tokens they can process at once. Wrapd AI Requests and Suggestions are not the same as Tokens, which are limited separately regardless of which plan you're on.

What is Lite?
**Lite** is a basic AI model included with the Turbo plan that serves two purposes:
  * **Fallback model** : If you reach your Turbo AI request limits, Wrapd automatically switches to Lite so you can keep using AI without interruption — at no additional cost.
  * **Standalone option** : You can also choose to use Lite before hitting your limits. In this case, usage will still count toward your monthly request limits, but once those limits are reached, Lite remains available with unlimited usage for Turbo plan users only.


Currently, Lite uses Gemini 2.0 Flash under the hood, but this may change over time as we evaluate different models. While performance and capabilities may vary compared to premium models, it allows you to continue using AI features without full interruption.
Note: Each query still counts as an AI request and contributes to your monthly usage, but using Lite won't incur any additional charges to your plan.

What happens when I exceed my request limits on Turbo?
If you exceed your monthly AI request limit on the Turbo plan (see [pricing](https://www.wrapd.dev/pricing) for current limits), Wrapd will automatically disable access to premium models and switch you to Lite.
You’ll still be able to use AI with no added cost — just through a more lightweight, basic model — until your quota resets at the start of your next billing cycle.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#how-often-does-my-wrapd-ai-request-limits-reset)
How often does my Wrapd AI request limits reset?
Allotted AI requests reset every 30 days from your signup date. When you upgrade to a Pro or Turbo plan, you will be given a higher request limit immediately. You can follow along with your refill period by referencing the counter under Settings -> AI.

How can I get the most out of my Wrapd Pro or Turbo plans?
Wrapd Pro and Turbo unlock powerful collaboration and knowledge-sharing tools to help your team move faster, together:
  * Use [Notebooks](https://docs.wrapd.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/wrapd-drive/notebooks) and [Workflows](https://docs.wrapd.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/wrapd-drive/workflows) in Wrapd Drive to organize and share knowledge across your team.
  * Try [Session Sharing](https://docs.wrapd.dev/features/session-sharing) to collaborate in real time through live, shared terminal sessions.


Wrapd Turbo also gives you the most AI power of any plan — with the highest monthly AI request limit (see [pricing](https://www.wrapd.dev/pricing) for details), access to our most advanced models, and unlimited [Lite](https://docs.wrapd.dev/support-and-billing/plans-and-pricing#what-is-lite) model usage.
Both plans are built for developers who want to uplevel their productivity with powerful collaboration features, with Turbo adding premium AI capabilities on top.

Before the launch of Wrapd's paid plan, certain features like Wrapd Drive for Teams and Wrapd AI were available in a Free Preview.
