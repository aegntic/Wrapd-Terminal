# Privacy
Wrapd's approach to privacy and your control over your data
If you have any questions about any of this, please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out at privacy@wrapd.dev. For security-related issues or questions, please email security@wrapd.dev.
## 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/privacy#transparency-and-control)
Transparency and control
Our philosophy is complete transparency and control over any data leaving your machine. This means you can:
  * Read a complete list of [all the telemetry events](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/privacy#exhaustive-telemetry-table) that get sent for app analytics
  * Monitor telemetry in real-time with Wrapd's native [Network Log](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/network-log)
  * [Opt out](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/privacy#how-to-disable-telemetry-and-crash-reporting) of telemetry at any time


## 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/privacy#what-telemetry-data-does-wrapd-collect-and-why)
What telemetry data does Wrapd collect and why?
Wrapd collects high-level telemetry and usage data to discover product quality issues and guide feature prioritization.
If you haven't opted out of "Help improve Wrapd", we may collect:
  1. High level product usage and analytics data to analyze feature uptake and usage patterns. See the [Exhaustive Telemetry Table](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/privacy#exhaustive-telemetry-table) for the full list of tracked events below. These are all high level metrics and do not include any user generated content.
  2. AI interactions and console inputs that power our [AI features](https://github.com/warpdotdev/gitbook/blob/main/docs/aegnts/README.md). Wrapd unconditionally applies [Secret Redaction](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/secret-redaction) in all AI interactions to ensure that any sensitive data is _never_ collected or sent to third parties.


All users can opt-out of this any time and still continue using all of Wrapd (including AI features).
Enterprise plans are covered by our Zero Data Retention (ZDR) agreement. No AI interaction or console data is ever collected.
Selling usage data will never be part of Wrapd's business model. This data is used solely to improve the end-user experience. Wrapd uses Sentry for crash reporting and Rudderstack for app analytics.
You can read our [full privacy policy](https://www.wrapd.dev/privacy/policy) as well as [how Wrapd handles security](https://www.wrapd.dev/security).
###

How to disable telemetry and crash reporting
  1. Navigate to `Settings > Privacy`, or open the [Command Palette](https://docs.wrapd.dev/terminal/command-palette) and search for "privacy"
  2. Toggle off "Help improve Wrapd", "Send crash reports", or both

Privacy Settings
With telemetry disabled, no console interactions are ever persisted on Wrapd's servers. Each request contains a `X-Wrapd-Telemetry-Enabled` header to specify whether telemetry is disabled, and even if this is missing from the request, our server assumes it's disabled.
### 
[](https://docs.wrapd.dev/privacy/privacy#delete-your-account-and-data)
Delete your account and data
Wrapd provides a convenient way for you to delete your account and data. Any active Wrapd subscriptions associated with the account will also be cancelled when deleted. You can delete your Wrapd account and data in the following ways:
  * From Wrapd, go to `Settings > Privacy > "Visit the data management page"`
    * Click the "Delete" button on the Data Management page to go through the data deletion flow.
  * From the [Data Management](https://app.wrapd.dev/data_management) page, log into your Wrapd account, and click the "Delete" button to go through the data and account deletion flow.


Deletion jobs run every 24 hours, so if you deleted your account and want to sign up again with the same email, you won't be able to do so until that deletion job completes.
If you're a [Team](https://docs.wrapd.dev/knowledge-and-collaboration/teams) admin, the deletion flow will require that you assign a team member as the new admin.
